What is Convolution Reverb? Convolution Reverb is a type of reverb that uses a mathematical process called convolution to create realistic and natural-sounding reverbs from real spaces or hardware. Convolution is a way of combining two signals to produce a third one that contains characteristics of both. In this case, the two signals are the dry sound (the input) and the impulse response (the sample of the space or device). The result is a wet sound (the output) that sounds like the input was played in the sampled space or device.
 
What are Impulse Responses? Impulse Responses (IRs) are recordings of how a space or a device responds to a short burst of sound, such as a clap, a gunshot, or a sine wave sweep. They capture the reflections, echoes, and frequency response of the space or device, and can be used to recreate its reverb characteristics. IRs can be recorded from any physical space, such as a concert hall, a church, a bathroom, or even a car. They can also be recorded from any reverb device, such as a plate reverb, a spring reverb, or a digital reverb unit.

How to Use Convolution Reverb? To use convolution reverb, you need a convolution reverb plugin and some IRs. You can load the IRs into the plugin and adjust the parameters to tweak the reverb sound. Some common parameters are dry/wet mix, pre-delay, decay time, damping, modulation, EQ, and reverse. You can also blend two or more IRs together to create hybrid reverbs. You can use convolution reverb on any track or bus in your DAW, but be aware that it can be CPU-intensive and cause latency.
 
Why Use Convolution Reverb? Convolution reverb is useful for adding realistic and natural-sounding reverbs to your audio. It can help you create a sense of depth, space, and dimension in your mix. It can also help you match the reverb of different sources that were recorded in different environments. For example, you can use convolution reverb to make a dialogue recorded in a studio sound like it was recorded in the same location as the video footage. You can also use convolution reverb for creative purposes, such as adding unusual or exotic reverbs to your sounds.
